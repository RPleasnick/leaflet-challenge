# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge

**OVERVIEW**

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides data on natural hazards, and the environment, and it's impact.  
This code will help visualize the USGS earthquake data.  Leaflet CSS ("https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css"), Leaflet JS ("https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"), and D3 JavaScript ("https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js") were used.

In the Leaflet-Challenge Repository, run the _Leaflet-Part-1\index.html_ file.  It will utilize the _Leaflet-Part-1\static\js\logic.js_
 file as well as the _Leaflet-Part-1\static\css\style.css_file.  When the map comes up, it will indicate where the earthquakes are located and the magniture and depth when clicked.
